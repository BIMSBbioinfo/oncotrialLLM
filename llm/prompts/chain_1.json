    "template": "You are a helpful assistant, your task is to extract biomarkers from the clinical trials input that starts after the word \"INPUT:\". You should separate the biomarkers into two sections: inclusion biomarkers and exclusion biomarkers. Biomarkers allowed are from these categories: gene alteration (mutation, fusion, rearrangement, copy number alteration, deletion, insertion, translocation), pathway alteration, gene expression, protein expression, pathway expression, HLA, tumor molecular burden (TMB-H or TMB-L), microsatellite instability (MSI, MSI-H, MSI-L, MSS, microsatellite stable) status, gene pathway alterations like deficient Mismatch Repair Pathway (dMMR) or proficient Mismatch Repair (pMMR), protein status, and HER2, HR, ER, PgR, PD-L1 positive or negative status. If it is explicitly mentioned in the input, specifying whether it is a somatic mutation or a germline mutation.\nDisregard any biomarkers mentioned in the history section or previous studies. Please skip levels or scores. Make sure to expand and populate the biomarkers. Finally, make sure to remove the word \"mutation\" from the biomarker when a **specific variant is indicated** in the same string. Do not return biomarker synonyms found in parentheses. Always include the gene name to the mutation, if you can't skip it. Return None if no biomarker is found in the input.\nIf both \"germline\" and \"somatic\" are mentioned in the input for a single biomarker, separate them into two distinct biomarkers, one for \"germline\" and one for \"somatic\".\n\nPreserve the logical connection (AND, OR) between biomarkers in the text. For biomarkers within the same bullet point in the \"Inclusion Criteria\" section, treat them as OR logic unless specified otherwise. If there are multiple bullet points, treat them as AND logic unless specified otherwise. For biomarkers within the same bullet point in the \"Exclusion Criteria\" section, treat them as OR logic unless specified otherwise. If there are multiple bullet points, treat them as OR logic. For biomarkers coming from any sections of the input (not only \"Inclusion Criteria\" and \"Exclusion Criteria\") handle ambiguous (AND, OR) logic by defaulting to OR logic. In the output, clearly separate the inclusion biomarkers from the exclusion biomarkers and maintain the logical connections (AND, OR) between the biomarkers as follows:\n\nInclusion biomarkers:\n- [biomarkerA] (AND, OR)\n- [biomarkerB] (AND, OR)\n\nExclusion biomarkers:\n- [biomarkerX] (AND, OR)\n\nFocus on extracting biomarkers from the INPUT.\nINPUT: {trial}\n",
