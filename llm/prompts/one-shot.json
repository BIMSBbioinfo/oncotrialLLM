    "template": "As an intelligent assistant, your task is to extract, process, and structure biomarkers from the clinical trials input that starts after the word \"INPUT:\". You must maintain the logical connections (AND, OR) between biomarkers and follow the provided instructions using Chain of Thought, reasoning, and common sense.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \nReturn a JSON in the following format: {{\"inclusion_biomarker\": [], \"exclusion_biomarker\": []}}. Each key contains a list of lists of strings, where each inner list represents a set of genomic biomarkers required for patient inclusion or exclusion in the trial.\n\nExtract biomarkers from the input only and avoid any information from the instructions. Focus on extracting biomarkers in the following categories: gene alteration (single mutation, fusion, rearrangement, copy number alteration, deletion, insertion, translocation), pathway alteration, gene expression, protein expression, path-way expression, HLA, TMB (tumor molecular burden, TMB-H or TMB-L), MSI (microsatellite instability, MSI-H, MSI-L, MSS, microsatellite stable) status, gene pathway alterations like dMMR (deficient Mismatch Repair Pathway) or pMMR (proficient Mismatch Repair), protein status, and HER2, ER, PgR, PD-L1 positive or negative status. Ignore any items that don't fall into these categories. Place the extracted biomarkers under the appropriate key, \"inclusion_biomarker\" or \"exclusion_biomarker\", based on whether they are required for patient inclusion or exclusion in the trial.\n\nOmit information related to age, medical condition, potential pregnancy, stage or phase of disease, allergies, treatment history, histology, specific cancer type, diseases or conditions, HIV, and infections. Disregard data about levels, scores, doses, or ratio of expression, as well as any illnesses. Do not extract biomarkers associated with model experimental animals or historical data or previous studies.\n\nPreserve the logical connection (AND, OR) between biomarkers in the input. Group biomarkers connected by 'AND' in the same list and place biomarkers connected by 'OR' in separate lists. Treat each main bullet in the \"Inclusion Criteria\" section as AND logic (unless specified as OR or different ARM/cohort) and main bullets in the \"Exclusion Criteria\" section as OR logic (unless explicitly stated otherwise). Handle ambiguous (AND, OR) logic by considering it as OR .\n\nProcess the biomarkers to ensure each one presents the gene name followed by the variant. Remove the words \"gene\", \"allele\", and \"status\" from the biomarker. Remove the term \"mutation\" from the biomarker when there's has a specific variant in the string (e.g CCND1 P287T mutation becomes CCND1 P287T). Make sure the variant is singular and noun-based (e.g \"translocated\" becomes \"translocation\"). Replace \"mutant\" with \"mutation\". Insert a space between the gene name and its variant, and also between the status and the hormone name. Replace the expression \"positive expression\" with just \"expression\". Replace symbols \"-\" and \"+\" with \"negative\" and \"positive\" respectlively, unless it's in the MSI status or known fusions separated by \"-\". When \"germline\" or \"somatic\" terms are mentioned in the input, place them in parentheses at the end of the corresponding biomarker. Ignore any biomarker mentioned as an \"exception\" or after \"other than\". Handle synonyms found in parentheses by extracting the biomarker but ignoring the synonym. Extract each biomarker once. Make sure to expand the biomarkers when needed.\n\nBefore returning the JSON output, remove any empty lists and stray empty lists caused by having no biomarkers in a category, ensuring that the keys \"inclusion_biomarker\" and \"exclusion_biomarker\" have just an empty list [] if there are no biomarkers in that category.\n\nBelow is an example. This example is for demonstration.\nEXAMPLE: {example}\n\nKeep in mind that you should extract biomarkers from clinical trials input that starts after the word \"INPUT:\". If the \"INPUT:\" has no biomarker, DO NOT extract biomarker from the example!\nINPUT: {trial}\nJSON:",
