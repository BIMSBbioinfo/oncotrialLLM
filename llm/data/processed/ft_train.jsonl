{"input": "Tumours require a blood supply to provide them with oxygen and nutrients and to enable spread\n of cancer through blood vessels to other organs (metastasis). The formation of new blood\n vessels is known as angiogenesis, which is controlled by a growth factor (like a hormone)\n called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Many drugs have been developed that block\n VEGF and, in most tumour types, including ovarian cancer, the addition of VEGF inhibitors\n (VEGFi) to conventional anti-cancer therapy postpones recurrence of the disease. In ovarian\n cancer, VEGFi improve the overall outcome from the cancer in patients who have advanced stage\n and high-risk disease. VEGFi are now widely used in cancer medicine, yet until now there have\n not been any biomarkers (tests) that could be used to tell patients and their doctors whether\n the drugs were working or not. This is important, as VEGFi have side effects that are\n unpleasant for the patient. Additionally, VEGFi treatments are expensive.\n The VALTIVE team has discovered the first biomarker that informs doctors whether a VEGFi is\n blocking a tumour's blood supply. The test involves measuring a protein in the blood called\n Tie2, which can be measured from routine blood tests that patients have when going to the\n hospital. If the test shows that the amount of Tie2 decreases in the blood, it means that\n tumour blood vessels are blocked by VEGFi; if, on the contrary, the level increases, the\n blood vessels have escaped the control of VEGFi.\n The investigators have shown that the Tie2 test works in their initial studies in ovarian and\n bowel cancer. In these studies, the Tie2 blood test was based in the research laboratories.\n The investigators now wish to establish the test in the Christie Hospital NHS Biochemistry\n laboratory in Manchester so that it can be used in clinical practice rather than just as a\n research tool. The investigators wish to measure the relationship between loss of control of\n VEGF inhibitors as measured by TIE 2 and other standard ways of measuring loss of control of\n the tumour like increases on CT scans. There are several reasons why this test is needed for\n patients with ovarian cancer:\n - VEGFi are effective during a patient's first or subsequent treatments for advanced\n ovarian cancer, but it is not clear which individuals are benefitting from treatment\n whilst they are on treatment.\n - Patients who have already had one course of VEGFi can be re-treated successfully.\n - Patients can avoid needless side effects, if there is a way of demonstrating that the\n treatment is of no benefit to them.\n - This test will help doctors choose the best drug to control ovarian cancer and how long\n to continue treatment. This is very important, since other maintenance therapies are now\n available and the optimal duration of VEGFi therapy is well known.\n - Around the world many teams are developing new combination treatments including VEGFi.\n If these new combinations prove effective, it would be possible to use them as\n efficiently as possible, as they will be very expensive and may therefore be less\n accessible to patients.\n These issues highlight the critical need to establish a test in the NHS that tells patients\n and their doctors when VEGFi are working and when they stop working.\n In VALTIVE1 study, blood samples will be taken from patients who are receiving a VEGFi called\n bevacizumab for ovarian cancer. Patients' management will not change during their\n participation to the trial. The analysis of the blood sample will support the hypothesis that\n patients whose Tie2 level decreases in response to bevacizumab will have ovarian cancer that\n is controlled for much longer than those where the Tie2 level does not decrease. These\n results will be used to design a second trial where the investigators will prove conclusively\n the value of the Tie2 test.\n The purpose of VALTIVE1 is to optimise sample acquisition time points and analytical\n algorithms to support the design of VALTIVE2, a randomised discontinuation trial. In\n VALTIVE2, Tie2-defined, vascular non-responding patients will be randomly allocated to stop\n bevacizumab after 9 weeks, by when a response can be detected, or to continue bevacizumab for\n the conventional year of treatment.\n Both VALTIVE 1 and VALTIVE2 will test the theory that there is no advantage in continuing\n bevacizumab in a patient whose Tie2 level does not reduce in response to VEGFi.\n ;\n ;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n In order to be eligible for participation in this trial, the patient must:\n 1.

{"input": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced non-small cell\n lung cancer (NSCLC), a group of lung cancers that have spread to nearby tissues or to other\n parts of the body.\n Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)\n are proteins that help cells to grow and divide. A damage (also called mutation) to the\n building plans (genes) for these proteins in cancer cells leads to a production of abnormal\n EGFR and/or HER2. These abnormal proteins drive the growth and the spread of the cancer.\n Several EGFR and/or HER2 mutations exist in the cancer cells. Two mutations observed in NSCLC\n are called EGFR- or HER2exon20ins and EGFR C797X. The study treatment, BAY2927088, works by\n blocking the mutated EGFR protein and also its ex20ins version which are present in NSCLC. It\n is also believed to work against HER2 and HER2ex20ins mutations. Researchers think this may\n help stop the further spread of NSCLC cancer.\n This is the first time that researchers will study BAY2927088 in humans. In this study, the\n researchers want to learn more about using BAY2927088 in participants who have NSCLC with\n EGFR and/or HER2 mutations including EGFRex20ins and/or HER2ex20ins mutations.\n The main aims of this study are to find for BAY2927088\n - how safe BAY2927088 is\n - how it affects the body (also referred to as tolerability)\n - how BAY2927088 moves into, through and out of the body\n - the maximum amount of BAY2927088 that the participants can take without too many side\n effects.\n The researchers will also study the action of BAY2927088 against the cancer. The study will\n have three parts: Dose Escalation, Backfill, and Dose Expansion. Each participant of the\n first, so called dose escalation part, will be assigned to one of specific sequential dose\n groups for BAY2927088. The amount of BAY2927088 that is given increases stepwise from one\n group to the next.\n The second may be initiated at any dose that has already been tested during the first part\n and found to be safe and to have either reached a predicted efficacious exposure range or to\n have induced an objective response. The first part and second part will run concurrently.\n The participants of the third, so called dose expansion part, will receive the most\n appropriate dose of BAY2927088 found in the first and second parts. The third part may be\n initiated in parallel with the first and second part based on emerging data.\n During the study, the participants will take the study treatment in 3 week periods called\n \"cycles\". They will in general take BAY2927088 once daily until their cancer gets worse,\n until they have medical problems, until they leave the study or until the study is\n terminated. Participants will have around 5 visits in each cycle.\n During the study, the study team will:\n - take blood and urine samples\n - take regular CT or MRI scans to check if the participants' cancer has gotten better or\n worse\n - check the participants' overall health and heart health\n - ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they\n are having.\n An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep\n track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse\n events might be related to the study treatments.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - Documented histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced NSCLC, not\n suitable for definitive therapy or recurrent or metastatic NSCLC at screening (small\n cell or mixed histologies are excluded).\n - Documented disease progression after treatment with at least one prior systemic\n therapy for advanced disease.

{"input": "This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works before surgery in treating patients\n with mismatch repair deficient solid cancers that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes\n (locally advanced).

{"input": "BRAF mutation exists in about 10-12% of colorectal cancer, among which BRAF V600E mutation is\n the most common type, which is an important biomarker for predicting the prognosis and\n precise treatment efficacy of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The prognosis of\n metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation is very poor, with OS of about 6-9\n months. Previous studies have shown that single anti-BRAF inhibitor are ineffective, while\n multi-target inhibitions of Ras-Raf -MEK pathway is a possible effective strategy for BRAF\n V600E-mutant mCRC. Currently, the proven effective regimens include the VIC regimen\n (Vemurafenib + cetuximab + Irinotecan) and BEACON regimen (Encorafenib+ cetuximab +/-\n Binimetinib) from the SWOGS1406 study.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine\n phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the\n cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. NKTR-255 is an\n investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability\n to fight cancer. Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and chemotherapy in combination with NKTR-255\n may work better in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute\n lymphoblastic leukemia.\n ;\n ;\n For B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\n 1.

If\n patient has received anti-CD19 targeted therapy (i.e. Blinatumomab or CD19-CAR T\n cells), then CD19 expression must be subsequently demonstrated. CD19 expression may be\n detected by immunohistochemistry or by flow cytometry. The choice of whether to use\n flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily\n available tissue sample in each subject. In general, immunohistochemistry will be used\n for lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone\n marrow samples.\n 6. Subjects who have undergone autologous SCT with disease progression or relapse\n following SCT are eligible.
