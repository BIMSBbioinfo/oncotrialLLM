Here's the json schema you must adhere to:<schema>{\"inclusion_biomarker\": [[]], \"exclusion_biomarker\": [[]]}</schema>\nIn this context, limit the extraction of genomic biomarkers to the following categories: gene alteration (mutation, fusion, rearrangement, copy number alteration, deletion, insertion, translocation), pathway alterations, gene expression, protein expression, pathway expression, HLA, TMB (tumor molecular burden, TMB-H or TMB-L), MSI (microsatellite instability, MSI-H, MSI-L, MSS, microsatellite stable) status, gene pathway alteration like dMMR (deficient Mismatch Repair Pathway) or pMMR (proficient Mismatch Repair), and protein status (HER2, ER, PgR, PD-L1).\n\nDo not extract non-genomic biomarkers, which refer to any indicators not directly related to genetic or genomic information. Ignore information such as age, medical conditions, potential pregnancy, disease stage, allergies, treatment history, drugs, therapies, treatment, histology, and tumor cancer types, diseases, HIV, infections, and more. Also, ignore information about levels, scores, doses, expression ratios, and illnesses. Do not consider biomarkers related to model experimental animals, historical data, or previous studies.\n\nPreserve logical connections (AND, OR) between genomic biomarkers. Group 'AND'-linked genomic biomarkers in the same list, and place 'OR'-linked genomic biomarkers in separate lists. Treat main bullets in \"Inclusion Criteria\" as AND logic, and \"Exclusion Criteria\" as OR logic, unless specified otherwise. Handle ambiguous logic in the sentence as OR.\n\nEnsure each genomic biomarker is a string with the gene name preceding the variant. Remove the words \"gene\", \"allele\", \"status\", and \"mutation\" (when a specific variant is given). Make the variant singular and noun-based. Replace \"mutant\" with \"mutation\". Include a space between the gene name, its variant if they are connected. Include a space between the hormone name and its status if they are connected. Replace \"positive expression\" with \"expression\" and symbols \"-\" and \"+\" with \"negative\" and \"positive\" respectively, except in MSI status or known fusions separated by \"-\". Add \"germline\" or \"somatic\" terms in parentheses at the end of the corresponding biomarker. Ignore biomarkers mentioned as \"exceptions\" or after \"other than\". Handle synonyms in parentheses by extracting the genomic biomarker but ignoring the synonym. Extract each genomic biomarker once. Expand the genomic biomarkers when needed.\n\nTo summarize, extract only genomic biomarkers from the supplied clinical trial data, focusing on the categories mentioned above. Ignore any non-genomic biomarkers and unrelated information such as age, medical conditions, treatment history, cancer, drugs, therapies, histology, levels and scores. If no genomic biomarkers are found, return empty lists in JSON. Do not make assumptions or add biomarkers. Do not add any biomarkers that are not explicitly mentioned in the input, and do not make assumptions about potential genomic biomarkers. Ensure output list contains only lists of strings when there exist genomic biomarkers in the input, following this example: {\"inclusion_biomarker\": [[\"GeneA variantA\"], [\"GeneX variantY]], \"exclusion_biomarker\": []}.

DDR deficiency refers to a decrease in the ability of cells to respond to\\n damaged DNA and to repair the damage, which can be caused by genetic mutations. Immunotherapy\\n with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the\\n cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. M6620 may stop\\n the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving\\n avelumab together with M6620 may help to control DDR deficient metastatic or unresectable\\n solid tumors.\\n ;\\n ;\\n Inclusion Criteria:\\n - Subjects must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or\\n unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no longer\\n effective\\n - Subjects will be eligible for this study based on the presence of actionable\\n aberrations in one or more of the following DNA damage response (DDR) genes: ARID1A,\\n ATM, ATR, ATRX, BAP1, BARD1, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2,\\n FANCE, FANCF, FANCM, MRE11A, MSH2, NBN (NBS1), PALB2, RAD51, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMARCB1,\\n and VHL, or other related genes at the discretion of the principal investigator in\\n consultation with the MD Anderson Cancer Center Institute for Personalized Cancer\\n Therapy Precision Oncology Decision Support (PODS) group.

{"input": "This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works before surgery in treating patients\n with mismatch repair deficient solid cancers that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes\n (locally advanced). Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to genes (DNA) that control the\n way cells function, and some of these mutations can cause tumor cells to grow quickly and out\n of control. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors are made up of cancer cells that\n have a greater than normal number of genetic markers called microsatellites. These cancers\n may have defects in the ability to correct mutations that occur when DNA is copied in the\n cell. Similarly, mismatch repair deficient tumors (dMMR) may have difficulty repairing some\n type of genetic mutation during cellular replication that may affect tumor's response to\n cancer therapy.
