{"input": "Flonoltinib Maleate (FM) targets Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3).\n FM is a dual target inhibitor of JAK2/FLT3.FM has the activity of inhibiting JAK2 signaling\n pathway, and pharmacodynamics evaluation also confirmed that FM has a good therapeutic effect\n on the primary splenomegaly model of mice induced by JAK2V617 mutation.Therefore, FM has the\n potential to treat bone marrow proliferative tumors.The drug is intended to be used in\n patients with MPN, mainly including medium-risk or high-risk myelofibrosis (FM) (including\n primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PostPV-MF) and\n post-primary thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (postET-MF)), Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential\n thrombocythemia (ET) were the primary causes of thrombocythemia and thrombocythemia.\n FM has high inhibitory activity against JAK family and FLT3 kinase, suggesting that FM may\n have a certain therapeutic effect on AML disease.The IC50 of JAK2 kinase inhibition by FM was\n as low as 0.8 nM, while the IC50 of JAK1, JAK3 and Tyk2 kinase inhibition was 690 nM, 557 nM\n and 65nM, respectively. The selectivity of JAK2 kinase inhibition by FM was 862.5, 696.3 and\n 81.3 times, respectively. Therefore, FM showed highly selective inhibition of JAK2 kinase.The\n IC50 for FLT3 kinase was 15 nM. FM has better inhibitory activity against JAK2 kinase than\n the listed Ruxolitinib and Fedratinib, and has better selectivity against JAK family.In order\n to determine whether FM has targets other than JAK2 and Flt3 kinases, we tested FM's\n inhibitory activity against 100 human kinases that are highly associated with tumors,\n including some common drug-resistant mutant kinases.The results showed that, except for\n CDK4/6, LCK and LN, FM had no obvious inhibitory activity against the screened kinases at 0.1\n \u03bcm, and no other targets were found.\n In vitro experiments on the proliferation of JAK2-dependent and Flt3-related tumor cell lines\n with FM showed that the tumor cell lines had a significant inhibitory effect. The IC50 of\n half of the tumor cell lines was less than 0.5 \u03bcm, which was better than or equal to the\n similar drugs Ruxolitinib and Fedratinib.\n The effect of FM on tumor cells from MPN patients indicated that FM has the potential to\n treat MPN disease.\n In multiple animal models of bone marrow proliferative tumors with JAK2V617F mutations, FM\n showed superior efficacy and low toxicity (no obvious VISCAL toxicity) than existing drugs on\n the market, and the tumor inhibition effect of FM showed a good dose-dependent relationship.\n Objectives of Study\n Main Purpose:\n 1.

{"input": "Imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is the\n current standard of care in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML. However,\n about 30% of patients still show drug resistance or disease progression. Currently, the most\n widely studied mechanism of TKI resistance in CML patients is mutations in the ABL kinase\n region. So far, more than 100 kinase domain mutations have been found in disease progression\n and imatinib resistance. It is estimated that more than 25% of CML patients will change TKI\n at least once in their lifetime due to drug resistance or intolerance. The 2020 edition of\n the \"Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in China\"\n proposes that patients with F317L/V/I/C, V299L and T315A mutations are more likely to obtain\n clinical efficacy by switching to the second-generation TKI nilotinib; patients with Y253H,\n E255K/V and F359C/V/I mutations are more likely to obtain clinical efficacy by switching to\n the second-generation TKI dasatinib; patients with T315I mutations are resistant to both\n nilotinib and dasatinib. Flumatinib has been shown to be a more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL1\n tyrosine kinase than imatinib. In vitro studies, it has shown that flumatinib inhibits\n wild-type and common BCR-ABL mutations(Q252H, V299L, F317L/I, M351T, H396P, etc.) more\n potently, and the anti-mutation spectrum of flumatinib is similar to nilotinib.

{"input": "This phase II trial studies the effect of polatuzumab vedotin, venetoclax, and rituximab and\n hyaluronidase human in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has come back\n (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal\n antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79B\n positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Venetoclax may\n stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cell growth.\n Rituximab hyaluronidase is a combination of rituximab and hyaluronidase. Rituximab binds to a\n molecule called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types\n of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Hyaluronidase allows\n rituximab to be given by injection under the skin. Giving rituximab and hyaluronidase by\n injection under the skin is faster than giving rituximab alone by infusion into the blood.\n Giving polatuzumab vedotin, venetoclax, and rituximab and hyaluronidase human may work better\n than standard therapy in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma.\n ;\n ;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - Pathologically confirmed relapsed or primary refractory mantle cell lymphoma with\n concurrent or prior tissue sample immunohistochemistry (IHC) positive for cyclin D1 or\n that is positive for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or cytogenetics for\n t(11;14)\n - NOTE: Safety Portion only: MCL or indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)\n (follicular lymphoma [FL] [grades I-IIIa] marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]), or,\n small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) stratified as low risk for tumor lysis syndrome\n (TLS), relapsed or progressed after at least two lines of therapy (or one BTK\n inhibitor containing line of therapy).
