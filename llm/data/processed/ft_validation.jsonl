CD4+ Leukemias ( Liquid Blood and marrow disease):\n 1. Subjects at study entry with bone marrow malignant replacement estimated at > 80%\n of total cellularity and accompanied by significant peripheral pancytopenia, ANC\n <500, platelet count < 50,000 will need to have roughly 50% or greater reduction\n on the marrow malignant component to be considered eligible after cytoreductive\n chemotherapy and for CD4CAR infusion. This will be determined and approved by PI,\n treating physician and study team as applicable.\n 2. Subjects at study entry with bone marrow malignant replacement estimated at less\n than 80% of total cellularity will need to have stable disease or disease that is\n less than 80% in the marrow as determined and approved by the PI, treating\n physician and study team as applicable.\n Note: Bone marrow sampling is not an accurate reflection of disease burden because\n only a small biopsy is obtained to represent a patchy disease distributed all over the\n marrow. Hence these numbers and in the absence of severe cytopenias that are\n attributed to documented marrow replacement with malignant cells should not be\n formidable as is and borderline cases should be discussed and approved by the PI and\n the study team as applicable before moving forward.\n 2. Solid Mass Forming CD4+ lymphomas: (in lymph nodes or extra nodal sites)\n 1. Stage IV disease: Subjects with Stage IV disease that is deemed bulky by the\n standard definition of the presence of at least one site with a mass that is >\n 7.5 cm in largest diameter who have a 50% estimated reduction of total disease\n burden by imagining as read by radiology after conditioning chemotherapy are\n eligible to continue on study. In borderline cases, where they don't meet this\n criteria but are thought to have bulky disease by the treating investigator,\n clinical judgment will be required to determine eligibility of subjects who\n experience for example mixed responses; improved sites and progressed sites. In\n these cases, the PI, treating physician, and study team as applicable should\n agree and document that total disease burden has been reduced by about 50% when\n taking all sites involved into account as there is no objective method to make\n this estimated reduction if some areas improve and others don't, or even new\n sites arise.\n 2. Stage I-III disease: Subjects with stage I-III ( No extra nodal disease) who\n continue to have stable disease or better after conditioning chemotherapy are\n eligible to continue on study.\n 3. Skin Disease a. There will be no response or non-response criteria assessed that will\n be specific to skin disease since disease burden is almost never expected to be high\n without skin barrier violation and often involve infections that would make subjects\n ineligible at the time\n Eligibility for CD4CAR infusion:\n Inclusion\n 1. Afebrile and not receiving antipyretics, and no evidence of active infection\n 2. Specific organ function criteria for cardiac, renal, and liver function must be\n similar to initial inclusion values.
