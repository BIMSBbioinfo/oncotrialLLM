        "document": "This is a Phase II study for patients with MIBG avid tumors. The study is to determine the\n response rate to <131>I-MIBG in patients with de novo, relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma\n or other MIBG avid malignant tumors 42 days post MIBG therapy. It will also be evaluating the\n tolerability and safety of the study agent by evaluating the hematopoietic and\n non-hematopoietic toxicity of <131>I-MIBG therapy. Tumor response will be evaluated by\n comparing the patient's disease pre-treatment against the patient's day +42 post <131>I-MIBG\n treatment. The evaluations may include the following: <131>I-MIBG scan, CT or MRI, urine\n catecholamine, bone marrow analyses and any other tests considered standard of care for\n cancer evaluation. To be eligible for participation, patients must have tumors that are MIBG\n avid. Patients must also have a stem cell source for autologous rescue in the event of\n protracted therapy associated cytopenias. Peripheral stem cell collections are preferred as\n the hematopoietic cell source. Bone marrow harvests for a hematopoietic cell source is an\n alternative. This study will provide data for future clinical trials utilizing <131>I-MIBG\n therapies. A room on H12 has been prepared with lead lined walls, and many radiation safety\n components to accomodate this treatment. <131>I metaiodobenzlguanidine (<131>I-MIBG) is a\n radiopharmaceutical that concentrates within adrenomedullary tissue. The agent was initially\n used for tumor imaging due to its capability to locate pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas and\n other neuroendocrine tumors. <131>I-MIBG was subsequently used as an therapeutic agent for\n these tumor types. Phase I and II therapeutic trials targeting neuroblastoma have reported\n response rates of 10-50%. Toxicities observed have been mainly hematopoietic, with ~50% of\n patients receiving 15mCi/kg requiring stem cell reinfusion. Observed non-hematopoietic\n toxicities have been mild. Most recently, trials have been conducted combining the study\n agent with myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell reinfusion have been performed with\n initial response rates of ~50%.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - Patients must be between 12 months and 65 years at the time of enrollment\n - Diagnosis: diagnosis of neuroblastoma or at the time of relapse by histology and/or\n demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary\n catecholamine metabolites\n - Disease Status:\n 1.

The prognosis of\n metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation is very poor, with OS of about 6-9\n months. Previous studies have shown that single anti-BRAF inhibitor are ineffective, while\n multi-target inhibitions of Ras-Raf -MEK pathway is a possible effective strategy for BRAF\n V600E-mutant mCRC. Currently, the proven effective regimens include the VIC regimen\n (Vemurafenib + cetuximab + Irinotecan) and BEACON regimen (Encorafenib+ cetuximab +/-\n Binimetinib) from the SWOGS1406 study.

        "document": "Tumours require a blood supply to provide them with oxygen and nutrients and to enable spread\n of cancer through blood vessels to other organs (metastasis). The formation of new blood\n vessels is known as angiogenesis, which is controlled by a growth factor (like a hormone)\n called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Many drugs have been developed that block\n VEGF and, in most tumour types, including ovarian cancer, the addition of VEGF inhibitors\n (VEGFi) to conventional anti-cancer therapy postpones recurrence of the disease. In ovarian\n cancer, VEGFi improve the overall outcome from the cancer in patients who have advanced stage\n and high-risk disease. VEGFi are now widely used in cancer medicine, yet until now there have\n not been any biomarkers (tests) that could be used to tell patients and their doctors whether\n the drugs were working or not. This is important, as VEGFi have side effects that are\n unpleasant for the patient. Additionally, VEGFi treatments are expensive.\n The VALTIVE team has discovered the first biomarker that informs doctors whether a VEGFi is\n blocking a tumour's blood supply. The test involves measuring a protein in the blood called\n Tie2, which can be measured from routine blood tests that patients have when going to the\n hospital. If the test shows that the amount of Tie2 decreases in the blood, it means that\n tumour blood vessels are blocked by VEGFi; if, on the contrary, the level increases, the\n blood vessels have escaped the control of VEGFi.\n The investigators have shown that the Tie2 test works in their initial studies in ovarian and\n bowel cancer. In these studies, the Tie2 blood test was based in the research laboratories.\n The investigators now wish to establish the test in the Christie Hospital NHS Biochemistry\n laboratory in Manchester so that it can be used in clinical practice rather than just as a\n research tool. The investigators wish to measure the relationship between loss of control of\n VEGF inhibitors as measured by TIE 2 and other standard ways of measuring loss of control of\n the tumour like increases on CT scans. There are several reasons why this test is needed for\n patients with ovarian cancer:\n - VEGFi are effective during a patient's first or subsequent treatments for advanced\n ovarian cancer, but it is not clear which individuals are benefitting from treatment\n whilst they are on treatment.\n - Patients who have already had one course of VEGFi can be re-treated successfully.\n - Patients can avoid needless side effects, if there is a way of demonstrating that the\n treatment is of no benefit to them.\n - This test will help doctors choose the best drug to control ovarian cancer and how long\n to continue treatment. This is very important, since other maintenance therapies are now\n available and the optimal duration of VEGFi therapy is well known.\n - Around the world many teams are developing new combination treatments including VEGFi.\n If these new combinations prove effective, it would be possible to use them as\n efficiently as possible, as they will be very expensive and may therefore be less\n accessible to patients.\n These issues highlight the critical need to establish a test in the NHS that tells patients\n and their doctors when VEGFi are working and when they stop working.\n In VALTIVE1 study, blood samples will be taken from patients who are receiving a VEGFi called\n bevacizumab for ovarian cancer. Patients' management will not change during their\n participation to the trial. The analysis of the blood sample will support the hypothesis that\n patients whose Tie2 level decreases in response to bevacizumab will have ovarian cancer that\n is controlled for much longer than those where the Tie2 level does not decrease. These\n results will be used to design a second trial where the investigators will prove conclusively\n the value of the Tie2 test.\n The purpose of VALTIVE1 is to optimise sample acquisition time points and analytical\n algorithms to support the design of VALTIVE2, a randomised discontinuation trial. In\n VALTIVE2, Tie2-defined, vascular non-responding patients will be randomly allocated to stop\n bevacizumab after 9 weeks, by when a response can be detected, or to continue bevacizumab for\n the conventional year of treatment.\n Both VALTIVE 1 and VALTIVE2 will test the theory that there is no advantage in continuing\n bevacizumab in a patient whose Tie2 level does not reduce in response to VEGFi.\n ;\n ;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n In order to be eligible for participation in this trial, the patient must:\n 1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial\n 2. Age 16 years or over on day of signing informed consent\n 3. 3.

Adequate venous access for apheresis and no other contraindications for leukapheresis\n Exclusion Criteria\n 1. Pregnant or lactating women. The safety of this therapy on unborn children is not\n known. Female study participants of reproductive potential (see definition below) must\n have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to initiation of conditioning\n chemotherapy, per research sites' clinical policy.\n 2. Uncontrolled active infection.\n 3. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.\n 4. Concurrent use of systemic glucocorticoids in greater than replacement doses or\n steroid dependency. Recent or current use of inhaled glucocorticoids is not\n exclusionary.\n \u2022 Note: The following doses of glucocorticoids are permitted:\n 1. Hydrocortisone 25mg/day or less\n 2. Prednisone 10mg/day or less\n 3. Dexamethasone 4mg or less\n 5. Any previous treatment with any gene therapy products.\n 6.

Patients declining to consent for treatment\n 9. Absolute lymphocyte count <500/mm3 (<0.5 x 109 /L) (can be repeated, if indicated and\n possible)\n Screen Failures\n First point screen failure: Apheresis Subject with an absolute lymphocyte count < 500/mm3\n at the time of apheresis will be considered a screenfailure.\n Note: This test may be repeated in 2-3 weeks or often as needed to meet eligibility for\n apheresis, as long as the subject otherwise continues to be eligible.\n Second point screen failure\n Subjects who fail to cytoreduce with conditioning chemotherapy with persistence of high\n disease burden will be considered a screenfail according to the guidelines below:\n 1. CD4+ Leukemias ( Liquid Blood and marrow disease):\n 1. Subjects at study entry with bone marrow malignant replacement estimated at > 80%\n of total cellularity and accompanied by significant peripheral pancytopenia, ANC\n <500, platelet count < 50,000 will need to have roughly 50% or greater reduction\n on the marrow malignant component to be considered eligible after cytoreductive\n chemotherapy and for CD4CAR infusion. This will be determined and approved by PI,\n treating physician and study team as applicable.\n 2. Subjects at study entry with bone marrow malignant replacement estimated at less\n than 80% of total cellularity will need to have stable disease or disease that is\n less than 80% in the marrow as determined and approved by the PI, treating\n physician and study team as applicable.\n Note: Bone marrow sampling is not an accurate reflection of disease burden because\n only a small biopsy is obtained to represent a patchy disease distributed all over the\n marrow. Hence these numbers and in the absence of severe cytopenias that are\n attributed to documented marrow replacement with malignant cells should not be\n formidable as is and borderline cases should be discussed and approved by the PI and\n the study team as applicable before moving forward.\n 2. Solid Mass Forming CD4+ lymphomas: (in lymph nodes or extra nodal sites)\n 1. Stage IV disease: Subjects with Stage IV disease that is deemed bulky by the\n standard definition of the presence of at least one site with a mass that is >\n 7.5 cm in largest diameter who have a 50% estimated reduction of total disease\n burden by imagining as read by radiology after conditioning chemotherapy are\n eligible to continue on study. In borderline cases, where they don't meet this\n criteria but are thought to have bulky disease by the treating investigator,\n clinical judgment will be required to determine eligibility of subjects who\n experience for example mixed responses; improved sites and progressed sites. In\n these cases, the PI, treating physician, and study team as applicable should\n agree and document that total disease burden has been reduced by about 50% when\n taking all sites involved into account as there is no objective method to make\n this estimated reduction if some areas improve and others don't, or even new\n sites arise.\n 2. Stage I-III disease: Subjects with stage I-III ( No extra nodal disease) who\n continue to have stable disease or better after conditioning chemotherapy are\n eligible to continue on study.\n 3. Skin Disease a. There will be no response or non-response criteria assessed that will\n be specific to skin disease since disease burden is almost never expected to be high\n without skin barrier violation and often involve infections that would make subjects\n ineligible at the time\n Eligibility for CD4CAR infusion:\n Inclusion\n 1. Afebrile and not receiving antipyretics, and no evidence of active infection\n 2. Specific organ function criteria for cardiac, renal, and liver function must be\n similar to initial inclusion values. Tests such as echocardiogram and PFTs need not be\n repeated if within 6 weeks of initial assessment.\n 3. Negative pregnancy testing (if applicable)\n 4. If previous history of corticosteroid chemotherapy, subject must be off all but\n adrenal replacement doses\n 5. Planned infusion dose was successfully manufactured and met release criteria.",

        "document": "Flonoltinib Maleate (FM) targets Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3).\n FM is a dual target inhibitor of JAK2/FLT3.FM has the activity of inhibiting JAK2 signaling\n pathway, and pharmacodynamics evaluation also confirmed that FM has a good therapeutic effect\n on the primary splenomegaly model of mice induced by JAK2V617 mutation.Therefore, FM has the\n potential to treat bone marrow proliferative tumors.The drug is intended to be used in\n patients with MPN, mainly including medium-risk or high-risk myelofibrosis (FM) (including\n primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PostPV-MF) and\n post-primary thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (postET-MF)), Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential\n thrombocythemia (ET) were the primary causes of thrombocythemia and thrombocythemia.\n FM has high inhibitory activity against JAK family and FLT3 kinase, suggesting that FM may\n have a certain therapeutic effect on AML disease.The IC50 of JAK2 kinase inhibition by FM was\n as low as 0.8 nM, while the IC50 of JAK1, JAK3 and Tyk2 kinase inhibition was 690 nM, 557 nM\n and 65nM, respectively. The selectivity of JAK2 kinase inhibition by FM was 862.5, 696.3 and\n 81.3 times, respectively. Therefore, FM showed highly selective inhibition of JAK2 kinase.The\n IC50 for FLT3 kinase was 15 nM. FM has better inhibitory activity against JAK2 kinase than\n the listed Ruxolitinib and Fedratinib, and has better selectivity against JAK family.In order\n to determine whether FM has targets other than JAK2 and Flt3 kinases, we tested FM's\n inhibitory activity against 100 human kinases that are highly associated with tumors,\n including some common drug-resistant mutant kinases.The results showed that, except for\n CDK4/6, LCK and LN, FM had no obvious inhibitory activity against the screened kinases at 0.1\n \u03bcm, and no other targets were found.\n In vitro experiments on the proliferation of JAK2-dependent and Flt3-related tumor cell lines\n with FM showed that the tumor cell lines had a significant inhibitory effect. The IC50 of\n half of the tumor cell lines was less than 0.5 \u03bcm, which was better than or equal to the\n similar drugs Ruxolitinib and Fedratinib.\n The effect of FM on tumor cells from MPN patients indicated that FM has the potential to\n treat MPN disease.\n In multiple animal models of bone marrow proliferative tumors with JAK2V617F mutations, FM\n showed superior efficacy and low toxicity (no obvious VISCAL toxicity) than existing drugs on\n the market, and the tumor inhibition effect of FM showed a good dose-dependent relationship.\n Objectives of Study\n Main Purpose:\n 1.

Confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL of one of the following\n types:\n - Chemotherapy refractory disease in subjects with B-ALL, defined as progression or\n stable disease after one line of therapy.\n - Recurrence of disease after achieving CR.\n 2. Subjects with persistent or relapsed minimal residual disease (MRD) (by flow\n cytometry, PCR, FISH, or next generation sequencing) require verification of MRD\n positivity on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart.\n 3. Subjects with Philadelphia Chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL)\n subjects are eligible if they progressed after receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor\n (TKI).\n 4. Subjects with recurrence of isolated CNS relapse after achieving complete remission\n (CR); if relapsed with MRD, will require verification of MRD positivity on two\n occasions at least 4 weeks apart.\n 5. CD19 positive expression- CD19 expression is required at any time since diagnosis. If\n patient has received anti-CD19 targeted therapy (i.e. Blinatumomab or CD19-CAR T\n cells), then CD19 expression must be subsequently demonstrated. CD19 expression may be\n detected by immunohistochemistry or by flow cytometry. The choice of whether to use\n flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily\n available tissue sample in each subject. In general, immunohistochemistry will be used\n for lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone\n marrow samples.\n 6. Subjects who have undergone autologous SCT with disease progression or relapse\n following SCT are eligible. Subjects who have undergone allogeneic SCT will be\n eligible if, in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, they have elelino\n evidence of GVHD and have been without immunosuppressive agents for at least 30 days.\n 7. Subjects who have undergone prior anti-CD19 or anti-CD22 CAR therapy must be at least\n 30 days post CAR infusion and may not have eficence of persistnce of CAR T cells in\n blood smples (circulating levels of genetically modified cels of >/= 5% by flow\n cytometry.\n 8.

Subjects who are on standard ALL maintenance type chemotherapy (vincristine,\n 6-mercaptopurine or oral methotrexate) may be enrolled provided that chemotherapy\n is discontinued at least 1 week or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to\n apheresis.\n 3. Subjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses (\u22645 mg/day of\n prednisone or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids) only are allowed\n provided there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to\n starting apheresis;\n 4. For radiation therapy: Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 3\n weeks prior to apheresis, with the exception that there is no time restriction if\n the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the subject has\n measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation port.\n 10. Toxicities due to prior therapy must be stable and recovered to \u2264 Grade 1 (except for\n clinically non-significant toxicities such as alopecia)\n 11. Age 18 or older\n 12.

Serum ALT or AST \u2264 5x ULN (Elevated ALT/AST associated with leukemia or lymphoma\n involvement of the liver will not disqualify a subject; only one value required\n for eligibility).\n 7. Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 mg/dl, except in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome.\n 8. Cardiac ejection fraction \u2265 45%, no evidence of physiologically significant\n pericardial effusion as determined by an ECHO, MUGA or Cardiac MRI [performed\n within 180 days or after most recent anthracycline based treatment or mediastinal\n radiation therapy (whichever is most recent)]\n 9. No clinically significant ECG findings\n 10. No clinically significant pleural effusion\n 11. Baseline oxygen saturation > 92% on room air * A subject will not be excluded\n because of cytopenia if it is felt by the investigator to be due to underlying\n leukemia/lymphoma.\n 14. Subjects with CNS involvement are eligible as long as there are no overt signs or\n symptoms that in the evaluation of the investigator would mask or interfere with the\n neurological assessment of toxicity.\n 15. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test\n (females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for\n at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential)\n 16.

Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal\n antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79B\n positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Venetoclax may\n stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cell growth.\n Rituximab hyaluronidase is a combination of rituximab and hyaluronidase. Rituximab binds to a\n molecule called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types\n of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Hyaluronidase allows\n rituximab to be given by injection under the skin. Giving rituximab and hyaluronidase by\n injection under the skin is faster than giving rituximab alone by infusion into the blood.\n Giving polatuzumab vedotin, venetoclax, and rituximab and hyaluronidase human may work better\n than standard therapy in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma.\n ;\n ;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - Pathologically confirmed relapsed or primary refractory mantle cell lymphoma with\n concurrent or prior tissue sample immunohistochemistry (IHC) positive for cyclin D1 or\n that is positive for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or cytogenetics for\n t(11;14)\n - NOTE: Safety Portion only: MCL or indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)\n (follicular lymphoma [FL] [grades I-IIIa] marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]), or,\n small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) stratified as low risk for tumor lysis syndrome\n (TLS), relapsed or progressed after at least two lines of therapy (or one BTK\n inhibitor containing line of therapy).

        "document": "Imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is the\n current standard of care in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML. However,\n about 30% of patients still show drug resistance or disease progression. Currently, the most\n widely studied mechanism of TKI resistance in CML patients is mutations in the ABL kinase\n region. So far, more than 100 kinase domain mutations have been found in disease progression\n and imatinib resistance. It is estimated that more than 25% of CML patients will change TKI\n at least once in their lifetime due to drug resistance or intolerance. The 2020 edition of\n the \"Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in China\"\n proposes that patients with F317L/V/I/C, V299L and T315A mutations are more likely to obtain\n clinical efficacy by switching to the second-generation TKI nilotinib; patients with Y253H,\n E255K/V and F359C/V/I mutations are more likely to obtain clinical efficacy by switching to\n the second-generation TKI dasatinib; patients with T315I mutations are resistant to both\n nilotinib and dasatinib. Flumatinib has been shown to be a more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL1\n tyrosine kinase than imatinib. In vitro studies, it has shown that flumatinib inhibits\n wild-type and common BCR-ABL mutations(Q252H, V299L, F317L/I, M351T, H396P, etc.) more\n potently, and the anti-mutation spectrum of flumatinib is similar to nilotinib. Therefore,\n this study is designed to provide clearer guidance for patients with suboptimal response or\n failure in the treatment of TKI as well as those who have specific ABL kinase domain\n mutations during CML treatment.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n 1.

        "document": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced non-small cell\n lung cancer (NSCLC), a group of lung cancers that have spread to nearby tissues or to other\n parts of the body.\n Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)\n are proteins that help cells to grow and divide. A damage (also called mutation) to the\n building plans (genes) for these proteins in cancer cells leads to a production of abnormal\n EGFR and/or HER2. These abnormal proteins drive the growth and the spread of the cancer.\n Several EGFR and/or HER2 mutations exist in the cancer cells. Two mutations observed in NSCLC\n are called EGFR- or HER2exon20ins and EGFR C797X. The study treatment, BAY2927088, works by\n blocking the mutated EGFR protein and also its ex20ins version which are present in NSCLC. It\n is also believed to work against HER2 and HER2ex20ins mutations. Researchers think this may\n help stop the further spread of NSCLC cancer.\n This is the first time that researchers will study BAY2927088 in humans. In this study, the\n researchers want to learn more about using BAY2927088 in participants who have NSCLC with\n EGFR and/or HER2 mutations including EGFRex20ins and/or HER2ex20ins mutations.\n The main aims of this study are to find for BAY2927088\n - how safe BAY2927088 is\n - how it affects the body (also referred to as tolerability)\n - how BAY2927088 moves into, through and out of the body\n - the maximum amount of BAY2927088 that the participants can take without too many side\n effects.\n The researchers will also study the action of BAY2927088 against the cancer. The study will\n have three parts: Dose Escalation, Backfill, and Dose Expansion. Each participant of the\n first, so called dose escalation part, will be assigned to one of specific sequential dose\n groups for BAY2927088. The amount of BAY2927088 that is given increases stepwise from one\n group to the next.\n The second may be initiated at any dose that has already been tested during the first part\n and found to be safe and to have either reached a predicted efficacious exposure range or to\n have induced an objective response. The first part and second part will run concurrently.\n The participants of the third, so called dose expansion part, will receive the most\n appropriate dose of BAY2927088 found in the first and second parts. The third part may be\n initiated in parallel with the first and second part based on emerging data.\n During the study, the participants will take the study treatment in 3 week periods called\n \"cycles\". They will in general take BAY2927088 once daily until their cancer gets worse,\n until they have medical problems, until they leave the study or until the study is\n terminated. Participants will have around 5 visits in each cycle.\n During the study, the study team will:\n - take blood and urine samples\n - take regular CT or MRI scans to check if the participants' cancer has gotten better or\n worse\n - check the participants' overall health and heart health\n - ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they\n are having.\n An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep\n track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse\n events might be related to the study treatments.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - Documented histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced NSCLC, not\n suitable for definitive therapy or recurrent or metastatic NSCLC at screening (small\n cell or mixed histologies are excluded).\n - Documented disease progression after treatment with at least one prior systemic\n therapy for advanced disease.

        "document": "This is a single center and exploratory study, aiming to analyze the efficacy and safety of\n dacomitinib-a pan-HER and irreversible TKI in subjects with diagnosed stage IIIB/IV or\n recurrent NSCLC. All subjects will have tumors that test positive for at least one uncommon\n EGFR activating mutation (do not have drug-resistant pattern, e.g. 20 insertion or 20T790M).\n All patients will be of histo- and/or cytopathology confirmed. Determination of the EGFR\n mutation type will be performed in the pathological department of Shanghai Chest Hospital.\n Both ARMS method or targeted sequencing are acceptable. It is not acceptable for subjects\n with the presence of the exon 20T790M mutation or insertion together with either EGFR\n activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or the L858R mutation in exon 21) or uncommon EGFR\n mutations. 10ml peripheral blood must be available for concomitant study. All eligible\n subjects must have adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function, as defined in\n \"inclusion criteria\".\n Patients will receive continuous oral therapy with the study drugs (dacomitinib 45 mg) until\n progressive disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1 or judged by investigator that the\n patient no longer derives clinical benefit from study treatment. At the time of progression\n and removal from study treatment, the subject may receive any regulatory approved therapy at\n the judgment of the investigator. Timely and complete disease assessments in this study are\n important. Every effort should be made to ensure disease assessments performed as scheduled\n to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of efficacy. Failure to perform any\n of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status\n for that time point. Frequent off schedule or incomplete disease assessments have the\n potential to weaken the study conclusion.\n Subjects who have progressive disease per RECIST version 1.1 confirmed by the investigator\n believes it is in their best interest to continue on their study therapy, will be allowed to\n continue on their therapy with or without local therapy (e.g. surgical removal and/or\n radiation of a single lesion), at the discretion of the investigator until any alternate or\n additional systemic anti-cancer therapy regimen is implemented. The subsequent new cancer\n therapy (including, for systemic therapy, drugs administered, date of initiation and\n discontinuation of each drug) and OS will be recorded.

        "document": "Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), which diffusely occupy the pons of brainstem, are\n the deadliest primary brain cancer in children. Biopsy for pathology plus radiotherapy\n remains the current standard-of-care treatment that is minimal effective. Thus, the median\n overall survival after diagnosis is just 10 months. Recent studies have identified a lysine\n 27-to-methionine (K27M) somatic mutation at histone H3 variant (H3.3), as a feature mutation\n in DIPGs. Several preclinical studies have already demonstrated H3.3-K27M as a promising\n target for immunotherapy. The researched vaccine is a cancer-treatment vaccine containing an\n H3.3-K27M targeted neoantigen peptide, that can be taken up by antigen-presenting cells\n (APCs). APCs can present the peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)\n molecules on cell surface, thereby activating neoantigen-specific T cells and triggering\n corresponding cytotoxic T cell immune responses to eliminate H3.3-K27M-expressing DIPG cells.\n The main goal of this study is investigating the safety and preliminary efficacy of the\n vaccine in treating newly-diagnosed DIPGs when the vaccine is administered in combination\n with the standard-of-care treatment.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n A.
