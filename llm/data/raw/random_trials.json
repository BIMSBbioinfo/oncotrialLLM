            "document": "This is a Phase II study for patients with MIBG avid tumors. The study is to determine the\n response rate to <131>I-MIBG in patients with de novo, relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma\n or other MIBG avid malignant tumors 42 days post MIBG therapy. It will also be evaluating the\n tolerability and safety of the study agent by evaluating the hematopoietic and\n non-hematopoietic toxicity of <131>I-MIBG therapy. Tumor response will be evaluated by\n comparing the patient's disease pre-treatment against the patient's day +42 post <131>I-MIBG\n treatment. The evaluations may include the following: <131>I-MIBG scan, CT or MRI, urine\n catecholamine, bone marrow analyses and any other tests considered standard of care for\n cancer evaluation. To be eligible for participation, patients must have tumors that are MIBG\n avid. Patients must also have a stem cell source for autologous rescue in the event of\n protracted therapy associated cytopenias. Peripheral stem cell collections are preferred as\n the hematopoietic cell source. Bone marrow harvests for a hematopoietic cell source is an\n alternative. This study will provide data for future clinical trials utilizing <131>I-MIBG\n therapies. A room on H12 has been prepared with lead lined walls, and many radiation safety\n components to accomodate this treatment. <131>I metaiodobenzlguanidine (<131>I-MIBG) is a\n radiopharmaceutical that concentrates within adrenomedullary tissue. The agent was initially\n used for tumor imaging due to its capability to locate pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas and\n other neuroendocrine tumors. <131>I-MIBG was subsequently used as an therapeutic agent for\n these tumor types. Phase I and II therapeutic trials targeting neuroblastoma have reported\n response rates of 10-50%. Toxicities observed have been mainly hematopoietic, with ~50% of\n patients receiving 15mCi/kg requiring stem cell reinfusion. Observed non-hematopoietic\n toxicities have been mild. Most recently, trials have been conducted combining the study\n agent with myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell reinfusion have been performed with\n initial response rates of ~50%.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - Patients must be between 12 months and 65 years at the time of enrollment\n - Diagnosis: diagnosis of neuroblastoma or at the time of relapse by histology and/or\n demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary\n catecholamine metabolites\n - Disease Status:\n 1.

            "document": "BRAF mutation exists in about 10-12% of colorectal cancer, among which BRAF V600E mutation is\n the most common type, which is an important biomarker for predicting the prognosis and\n precise treatment efficacy of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The prognosis of\n metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation is very poor, with OS of about 6-9\n months. Previous studies have shown that single anti-BRAF inhibitor are ineffective, while\n multi-target inhibitions of Ras-Raf -MEK pathway is a possible effective strategy for BRAF\n V600E-mutant mCRC. Currently, the proven effective regimens include the VIC regimen\n (Vemurafenib + cetuximab + Irinotecan) and BEACON regimen (Encorafenib+ cetuximab +/-\n Binimetinib) from the SWOGS1406 study. Furthermore, BRAF inhibitor +MEK inhibitor combined\n with PD-1 monoclonal antibody has been shown to be an effective strategy in BRAF V600E-mutant\n malignant melanoma, which promote the study of the regimens for the treatment of BRAF\n V600E-mutant mCRC. Increasing basic and clinical studies have shown that cetuximab has ADCC\n effect, induces immunogenic cell death, promotes immune cell infiltration and other\n immunomodulatory effects, and has a synergistic effect with PD-1 monoclonal antibody in\n colorectal cancer. Based on those theories, we conducted the phase I study to explore the\n safety and preliminary efficacy of the regimen of Vemurafenib (BRAFi) plus cetuximab (EGFRi)\n combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody in BRAF V600E-mutant /MSS type mCRC.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n 1.

            "document": "Tumours require a blood supply to provide them with oxygen and nutrients and to enable spread\n of cancer through blood vessels to other organs (metastasis). The formation of new blood\n vessels is known as angiogenesis, which is controlled by a growth factor (like a hormone)\n called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Many drugs have been developed that block\n VEGF and, in most tumour types, including ovarian cancer, the addition of VEGF inhibitors\n (VEGFi) to conventional anti-cancer therapy postpones recurrence of the disease. In ovarian\n cancer, VEGFi improve the overall outcome from the cancer in patients who have advanced stage\n and high-risk disease. VEGFi are now widely used in cancer medicine, yet until now there have\n not been any biomarkers (tests) that could be used to tell patients and their doctors whether\n the drugs were working or not. This is important, as VEGFi have side effects that are\n unpleasant for the patient. Additionally, VEGFi treatments are expensive.\n The VALTIVE team has discovered the first biomarker that informs doctors whether a VEGFi is\n blocking a tumour's blood supply. The test involves measuring a protein in the blood called\n Tie2, which can be measured from routine blood tests that patients have when going to the\n hospital. If the test shows that the amount of Tie2 decreases in the blood, it means that\n tumour blood vessels are blocked by VEGFi; if, on the contrary, the level increases, the\n blood vessels have escaped the control of VEGFi.\n The investigators have shown that the Tie2 test works in their initial studies in ovarian and\n bowel cancer. In these studies, the Tie2 blood test was based in the research laboratories.\n The investigators now wish to establish the test in the Christie Hospital NHS Biochemistry\n laboratory in Manchester so that it can be used in clinical practice rather than just as a\n research tool. The investigators wish to measure the relationship between loss of control of\n VEGF inhibitors as measured by TIE 2 and other standard ways of measuring loss of control of\n the tumour like increases on CT scans. There are several reasons why this test is needed for\n patients with ovarian cancer:\n - VEGFi are effective during a patient's first or subsequent treatments for advanced\n ovarian cancer, but it is not clear which individuals are benefitting from treatment\n whilst they are on treatment.\n - Patients who have already had one course of VEGFi can be re-treated successfully.\n - Patients can avoid needless side effects, if there is a way of demonstrating that the\n treatment is of no benefit to them.\n - This test will help doctors choose the best drug to control ovarian cancer and how long\n to continue treatment. This is very important, since other maintenance therapies are now\n available and the optimal duration of VEGFi therapy is well known.\n - Around the world many teams are developing new combination treatments including VEGFi.\n If these new combinations prove effective, it would be possible to use them as\n efficiently as possible, as they will be very expensive and may therefore be less\n accessible to patients.\n These issues highlight the critical need to establish a test in the NHS that tells patients\n and their doctors when VEGFi are working and when they stop working.\n In VALTIVE1 study, blood samples will be taken from patients who are receiving a VEGFi called\n bevacizumab for ovarian cancer. Patients' management will not change during their\n participation to the trial. The analysis of the blood sample will support the hypothesis that\n patients whose Tie2 level decreases in response to bevacizumab will have ovarian cancer that\n is controlled for much longer than those where the Tie2 level does not decrease. These\n results will be used to design a second trial where the investigators will prove conclusively\n the value of the Tie2 test.\n The purpose of VALTIVE1 is to optimise sample acquisition time points and analytical\n algorithms to support the design of VALTIVE2, a randomised discontinuation trial. In\n VALTIVE2, Tie2-defined, vascular non-responding patients will be randomly allocated to stop\n bevacizumab after 9 weeks, by when a response can be detected, or to continue bevacizumab for\n the conventional year of treatment.\n Both VALTIVE 1 and VALTIVE2 will test the theory that there is no advantage in continuing\n bevacizumab in a patient whose Tie2 level does not reduce in response to VEGFi.\n ;\n ;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n In order to be eligible for participation in this trial, the patient must:\n 1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial\n 2. Age 16 years or over on day of signing informed consent\n 3. 3. Histologically proven ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer\n (henceforth referred to collectively as Ovarian Cancer - OC) FIGO stage III with\n residual disease of more than 1cm; or stage IV; or stage III at presentation treated\n with neoadjuvant chemotherapy; or stage III with contraindication to debulking surgery\n chemotherapy\n 4.

CD4+ Leukemias ( Liquid Blood and marrow disease):\n 1. Subjects at study entry with bone marrow malignant replacement estimated at > 80%\n of total cellularity and accompanied by significant peripheral pancytopenia, ANC\n <500, platelet count < 50,000 will need to have roughly 50% or greater reduction\n on the marrow malignant component to be considered eligible after cytoreductive\n chemotherapy and for CD4CAR infusion. This will be determined and approved by PI,\n treating physician and study team as applicable.\n 2. Subjects at study entry with bone marrow malignant replacement estimated at less\n than 80% of total cellularity will need to have stable disease or disease that is\n less than 80% in the marrow as determined and approved by the PI, treating\n physician and study team as applicable.\n Note: Bone marrow sampling is not an accurate reflection of disease burden because\n only a small biopsy is obtained to represent a patchy disease distributed all over the\n marrow. Hence these numbers and in the absence of severe cytopenias that are\n attributed to documented marrow replacement with malignant cells should not be\n formidable as is and borderline cases should be discussed and approved by the PI and\n the study team as applicable before moving forward.\n 2. Solid Mass Forming CD4+ lymphomas: (in lymph nodes or extra nodal sites)\n 1. Stage IV disease: Subjects with Stage IV disease that is deemed bulky by the\n standard definition of the presence of at least one site with a mass that is >\n 7.5 cm in largest diameter who have a 50% estimated reduction of total disease\n burden by imagining as read by radiology after conditioning chemotherapy are\n eligible to continue on study. In borderline cases, where they don't meet this\n criteria but are thought to have bulky disease by the treating investigator,\n clinical judgment will be required to determine eligibility of subjects who\n experience for example mixed responses; improved sites and progressed sites. In\n these cases, the PI, treating physician, and study team as applicable should\n agree and document that total disease burden has been reduced by about 50% when\n taking all sites involved into account as there is no objective method to make\n this estimated reduction if some areas improve and others don't, or even new\n sites arise.\n 2. Stage I-III disease: Subjects with stage I-III ( No extra nodal disease) who\n continue to have stable disease or better after conditioning chemotherapy are\n eligible to continue on study.\n 3. Skin Disease a. There will be no response or non-response criteria assessed that will\n be specific to skin disease since disease burden is almost never expected to be high\n without skin barrier violation and often involve infections that would make subjects\n ineligible at the time\n Eligibility for CD4CAR infusion:\n Inclusion\n 1. Afebrile and not receiving antipyretics, and no evidence of active infection\n 2.

            "document": "Flonoltinib Maleate (FM) targets Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3).\n FM is a dual target inhibitor of JAK2/FLT3.FM has the activity of inhibiting JAK2 signaling\n pathway, and pharmacodynamics evaluation also confirmed that FM has a good therapeutic effect\n on the primary splenomegaly model of mice induced by JAK2V617 mutation.Therefore, FM has the\n potential to treat bone marrow proliferative tumors.The drug is intended to be used in\n patients with MPN, mainly including medium-risk or high-risk myelofibrosis (FM) (including\n primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PostPV-MF) and\n post-primary thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (postET-MF)), Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential\n thrombocythemia (ET) were the primary causes of thrombocythemia and thrombocythemia.\n FM has high inhibitory activity against JAK family and FLT3 kinase, suggesting that FM may\n have a certain therapeutic effect on AML disease.The IC50 of JAK2 kinase inhibition by FM was\n as low as 0.8 nM, while the IC50 of JAK1, JAK3 and Tyk2 kinase inhibition was 690 nM, 557 nM\n and 65nM, respectively. The selectivity of JAK2 kinase inhibition by FM was 862.5, 696.3 and\n 81.3 times, respectively. Therefore, FM showed highly selective inhibition of JAK2 kinase.The\n IC50 for FLT3 kinase was 15 nM. FM has better inhibitory activity against JAK2 kinase than\n the listed Ruxolitinib and Fedratinib, and has better selectivity against JAK family.In order\n to determine whether FM has targets other than JAK2 and Flt3 kinases, we tested FM's\n inhibitory activity against 100 human kinases that are highly associated with tumors,\n including some common drug-resistant mutant kinases.The results showed that, except for\n CDK4/6, LCK and LN, FM had no obvious inhibitory activity against the screened kinases at 0.1\n \u03bcm, and no other targets were found.\n In vitro experiments on the proliferation of JAK2-dependent and Flt3-related tumor cell lines\n with FM showed that the tumor cell lines had a significant inhibitory effect. The IC50 of\n half of the tumor cell lines was less than 0.5 \u03bcm, which was better than or equal to the\n similar drugs Ruxolitinib and Fedratinib.\n The effect of FM on tumor cells from MPN patients indicated that FM has the potential to\n treat MPN disease.\n In multiple animal models of bone marrow proliferative tumors with JAK2V617F mutations, FM\n showed superior efficacy and low toxicity (no obvious VISCAL toxicity) than existing drugs on\n the market, and the tumor inhibition effect of FM showed a good dose-dependent relationship.\n Objectives of Study\n Main Purpose:\n 1.

A CAR is a genetically-engineered receptor made so that immune\n cells (T cells) can attack cancer cells by recognizing and responding to the CD19/CD22\n proteins. These proteins are commonly found on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and B acute\n lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine\n phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the\n cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. NKTR-255 is an\n investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability\n to fight cancer. Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and chemotherapy in combination with NKTR-255\n may work better in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute\n lymphoblastic leukemia.\n ;\n ;\n For B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\n 1.

CD19 expression may be\n detected by immunohistochemistry or by flow cytometry. The choice of whether to use\n flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily\n available tissue sample in each subject.

Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal\n antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79B\n positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Venetoclax may\n stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cell growth.\n Rituximab hyaluronidase is a combination of rituximab and hyaluronidase. Rituximab binds to a\n molecule called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types\n of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Hyaluronidase allows\n rituximab to be given by injection under the skin. Giving rituximab and hyaluronidase by\n injection under the skin is faster than giving rituximab alone by infusion into the blood.\n Giving polatuzumab vedotin, venetoclax, and rituximab and hyaluronidase human may work better\n than standard therapy in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma.\n ;\n ;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - Pathologically confirmed relapsed or primary refractory mantle cell lymphoma with\n concurrent or prior tissue sample immunohistochemistry (IHC) positive for cyclin D1 or\n that is positive for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or cytogenetics for\n t(11;14)\n - NOTE: Safety Portion only: MCL or indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)\n (follicular lymphoma [FL] [grades I-IIIa] marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]), or,\n small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) stratified as low risk for tumor lysis syndrome\n (TLS), relapsed or progressed after at least two lines of therapy (or one BTK\n inhibitor containing line of therapy).

            "document": "Imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is the\n current standard of care in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML. However,\n about 30% of patients still show drug resistance or disease progression. Currently, the most\n widely studied mechanism of TKI resistance in CML patients is mutations in the ABL kinase\n region. So far, more than 100 kinase domain mutations have been found in disease progression\n and imatinib resistance. It is estimated that more than 25% of CML patients will change TKI\n at least once in their lifetime due to drug resistance or intolerance. The 2020 edition of\n the \"Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in China\"\n proposes that patients with F317L/V/I/C, V299L and T315A mutations are more likely to obtain\n clinical efficacy by switching to the second-generation TKI nilotinib; patients with Y253H,\n E255K/V and F359C/V/I mutations are more likely to obtain clinical efficacy by switching to\n the second-generation TKI dasatinib; patients with T315I mutations are resistant to both\n nilotinib and dasatinib. Flumatinib has been shown to be a more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL1\n tyrosine kinase than imatinib. In vitro studies, it has shown that flumatinib inhibits\n wild-type and common BCR-ABL mutations(Q252H, V299L, F317L/I, M351T, H396P, etc.) more\n potently, and the anti-mutation spectrum of flumatinib is similar to nilotinib.

The contemporary clinical\n ALK fusion detection are mainly via FISH and ICH while biopsies are needed. For locations\n where are difficult to take biopsies, these routine examinations can hardly been adopted.\n Apart from these, part of ALK fusion patients are resistant to ALK inhibitors, also making an\n accurate and efficient prognostic indicator for efficacy evaluation and identifying high-risk\n recurrent population an urgent priority.\n The bilayer membrane structure of exosome helps maintain its internal genetic stability,\n making detection of EML4-ALK fusion via plasma exosomes in advanced NSCLC patients a feasible\n way, which might provide a non-invasive and more convenient approach for NSCLC diagnosis and\n efficacy monitoring.

            "document": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced non-small cell\n lung cancer (NSCLC), a group of lung cancers that have spread to nearby tissues or to other\n parts of the body.\n Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)\n are proteins that help cells to grow and divide. A damage (also called mutation) to the\n building plans (genes) for these proteins in cancer cells leads to a production of abnormal\n EGFR and/or HER2. These abnormal proteins drive the growth and the spread of the cancer.\n Several EGFR and/or HER2 mutations exist in the cancer cells. Two mutations observed in NSCLC\n are called EGFR- or HER2exon20ins and EGFR C797X. The study treatment, BAY2927088, works by\n blocking the mutated EGFR protein and also its ex20ins version which are present in NSCLC. It\n is also believed to work against HER2 and HER2ex20ins mutations. Researchers think this may\n help stop the further spread of NSCLC cancer.\n This is the first time that researchers will study BAY2927088 in humans. In this study, the\n researchers want to learn more about using BAY2927088 in participants who have NSCLC with\n EGFR and/or HER2 mutations including EGFRex20ins and/or HER2ex20ins mutations.\n The main aims of this study are to find for BAY2927088\n - how safe BAY2927088 is\n - how it affects the body (also referred to as tolerability)\n - how BAY2927088 moves into, through and out of the body\n - the maximum amount of BAY2927088 that the participants can take without too many side\n effects.\n The researchers will also study the action of BAY2927088 against the cancer. The study will\n have three parts: Dose Escalation, Backfill, and Dose Expansion. Each participant of the\n first, so called dose escalation part, will be assigned to one of specific sequential dose\n groups for BAY2927088. The amount of BAY2927088 that is given increases stepwise from one\n group to the next.\n The second may be initiated at any dose that has already been tested during the first part\n and found to be safe and to have either reached a predicted efficacious exposure range or to\n have induced an objective response. The first part and second part will run concurrently.\n The participants of the third, so called dose expansion part, will receive the most\n appropriate dose of BAY2927088 found in the first and second parts. The third part may be\n initiated in parallel with the first and second part based on emerging data.\n During the study, the participants will take the study treatment in 3 week periods called\n \"cycles\". They will in general take BAY2927088 once daily until their cancer gets worse,\n until they have medical problems, until they leave the study or until the study is\n terminated. Participants will have around 5 visits in each cycle.\n During the study, the study team will:\n - take blood and urine samples\n - take regular CT or MRI scans to check if the participants' cancer has gotten better or\n worse\n - check the participants' overall health and heart health\n - ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they\n are having.\n An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep\n track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse\n events might be related to the study treatments.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - Documented histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced NSCLC, not\n suitable for definitive therapy or recurrent or metastatic NSCLC at screening (small\n cell or mixed histologies are excluded).\n - Documented disease progression after treatment with at least one prior systemic\n therapy for advanced disease.

            "document": "Background:\n Meta-analyses of large randomized trials proved the superiority of preoperative short course\n radiation and surgery, as compared with surgery alone. Short course radiation results in a\n 50% reduction in terms of local relapse in stage II and III rectal cancer patients. Patients\n with complete pathological remission additionally show a significant survival benefit.\n Complete pathological remission (pCR) occurs in 8% after preoperative radiation and in >16%\n if the interval between radiation and surgery is at least 8 weeks.\n It is generally accepted that mutations in the TP53 gene represent a crucial defect in the\n apoptosis pathway. Radiation therapy is suggested to act via induction of apoptosis in\n irradiated cells. Therefore, it is expected that a defect in the TP53 gene has an effect on\n the success of radiation therapy.\n Currently available imaging tools are hardly able to diagnose response to radiation therapy\n correctly, as this does not essentially correlate with tumor size.\n Method:\n Aim of this prospective observation study is to strengthen the hypothesis that the TP53\n genotype is a promising marker to predict response to radiation therapy in rectal cancer\n patients. Consequently, the expected results will justify prospective, randomized\n intervention trials to obtain level of evidence I for the p53 marker hypothesis. Trial\n endpoint is downstaging and pCR rate. Tumor stage and pathological remission will be\n evaluated by MRT and pathohistology and correlated to the TP53 genotype of the diagnostic\n biopsy. Additionally, we will investigate the applicability of novel imaging modalities in\n magnet resonance tomography to monitor response to radiotherapy.\n The objective of this study is\n - to evaluate the effect of a genetic tumor marker (TP53 genotype) on the response to\n preoperative short course radiation (in terms of downstaging and pCR rate)\n - to evaluate the applicability of novel magnet resonance tomography imaging modalities to\n monitor response to preoperative short time radiation.\n Conclusion:\n The prospective evaluation of the potential predictive marker TP53 may bring us one-step\n closer to an individualized therapy regimen, which allows the restriction of preoperative\n radiation in rectal cancer to those patients who will benefit.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n Patients who are eligible for this observational study will be treated according to current\n standards with preoperative short course radiation (5x5 Gy) and a subsequent interval to\n surgery of at least 8 to maximum 16 weeks.\n According to standards of rectal cancer therapy, eligible patients will meet the following\n criteria:\n - Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum\n - Tumor staging with MRI\n - Inferior margin of the tumor located not farther than 15 cm from anal verge and below\n the level of S1-2\n - Tumor stage T2 and T3\n - No evidence of metastatic disease\n - No prior tumor therapy for rectal or pelvic cancers (surgery, radio-, chemo-,\n immunotherapy, molecular target therapy, or any other type of tumor therapy)\n - Medical fitness of the patient for treatment (decided by the involved physician)\n - Patient compliance\n - Signed informed consent from the patient or a legal representative, for the analysis\n of the tumor including genetic analyses of the tumor DNA.\n Exclusion Criteria:\n Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons\n - Clinical stage T1 (appropriate for local excision),\n - Clinical stage T4 (Radio/Chemotherapy)\n - Clinical stage M+ (distant metastases)\n - No tumor staging with MRI\n - Inoperability (technical or functional)\n - Prior tumor therapy of the pelvis\n - Concurrent administration of any other tumor therapy\n - Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration\n for study enrollment\n - Serious concomitant disorders or attitudes of the patient that would compromise the\n safety of the patient or his/her ability to complete the study."

Biopsy for pathology plus radiotherapy\n remains the current standard-of-care treatment that is minimal effective. Thus, the median\n overall survival after diagnosis is just 10 months. Recent studies have identified a lysine\n 27-to-methionine (K27M) somatic mutation at histone H3 variant (H3.3), as a feature mutation\n in DIPGs. Several preclinical studies have already demonstrated H3.3-K27M as a promising\n target for immunotherapy. The researched vaccine is a cancer-treatment vaccine containing an\n H3.3-K27M targeted neoantigen peptide, that can be taken up by antigen-presenting cells\n (APCs). APCs can present the peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)\n molecules on cell surface, thereby activating neoantigen-specific T cells and triggering\n corresponding cytotoxic T cell immune responses to eliminate H3.3-K27M-expressing DIPG cells.\n The main goal of this study is investigating the safety and preliminary efficacy of the\n vaccine in treating newly-diagnosed DIPGs when the vaccine is administered in combination\n with the standard-of-care treatment.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n A.

Our standard doses have been 35Gy/15#/3wks to the chest wall after\n mastectomy and 40Gy/16#/3wks after breast conserving surgery (BCS).It is also a routine\n practice in the UK and in a few centers in Canada. Hypofractionation reduces treatment time\n to half while maintaining cosmesis and gives control rates equal to conventional\n fractionation. As breast cancer is a leading cancer in females and radiation therapy is an\n important part of its local management, hypofractionation helps radiation centers worldwide\n to meet the growing need for radiation treatment in breast cancer, particularly in developing\n countries where resources are limited. It also reduces the financial burden on the patient\n and family. In this study we want to evaluate the impact of reducing the treatment duration\n from 3 weeks to 1 week. Eligible patients with breast cancer after mastectomy or BCS will be\n treated with a radiotherapy dose of 26Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week in the study arm and 40Gy\n in 15 fractions over 2 weeks in the control arm. The primary endpoint of this noninferiority\n study will be locoregional tumour control. Secondary endpoints will be early and late\n radiation toxicities, quality of life, contralateral primary tumours, regional and distant\n metastases, survival and second cancers. A total of 1018 patients will be randomised (1:1) to\n receive 1 week or 2 weeks of radiotherapy. An event-driven analysis will be performed after\n at least 94 patients have documented locoregional recurrences.\n ;\n ;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n 1. Age \u226518 years\n 2. Female or male\n 3.

            "document": "Background: Infiltrative low grade gliomas (LGGs) are the most common primary central nervous\n system malignancies excluding the highest grade glioma, glioblastoma multiforme. Craniotomy\n with maximal safe tumor resection is endeavored to achieve longer survivals in LGG patients.\n Unfortunately, due to the infiltrative nature of gliomas and the frequent tumor location in\n eloquent areas, gross total resection is usually not applicable. According to National\n Comprehensive Cancer Network 2015 guidelines, postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy (RT)\n is recommended for most adult patients with low-grade infiltrative LGGs in order to enhance\n local control and prolong progression-free survival (PFS), except those who are no older than\n 40 years of age and in whom maximal safe resection is not feasible. However, brain\n irradiation-related neurocognitive function (NCF) sequelae are potentially and indeed a\n concern which should not be ignored. In terms of the time course of cranial\n irradiation-induced NCF decline, it might vary considerably according to the specific domains\n which are selected to be measured. Early neurocognitive decline principally involve\n impairments of episodic memory, which has been significantly associated with functions of the\n hippocampus. This study thus aims to investigate the impact of partial brain irradiation with\n using contemporary radiotherapeutic techniques on neurocognitive performances, intracranial\n local control, and progression-free survival in patients with intracranial high-risk grade 2\n or 3 gliomas.\n Methods: Patients with intracranial high-risk low-grade or grade 3 gliomas will be enrolled\n to this study once postoperative adjuvant RT is recommended. All eligible and recruited\n patients should receive baseline functional brain MRI examination and baseline\n neurobehavioral assessment. Subsequently, partial cranial irradiation will be initiated\n within one month approximately after enrollment. Brain RT dose will be 5000 - 6000 cGy in 25\n - 30 fraction during 5 - 7 weeks. Accordingly, a battery of neuropsychological measures,\n which includes 7 standardized neuropsychological tests (e.g., executive functions, verbal &\n non-verbal memory, working memory, and psychomotor speed), is used to evaluate\n neurobehavioral functions for our registered patients. The primary outcome measure is delayed\n recall, as determined by the change/decline in verbal memory or non-verbal memory from the\n baseline assessment to 4 months after the start of postoperative adjuvant RT.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n - All patients with infiltrative low-grade gliomas who have received craniotomy plus\n tumor removal or at least biopsy with pathologic conformation; brain radiation therapy\n is recommended owning to some high-risk features including subtotal resection (STR) or\n age at craniotomy older than 40 years old\n - Good performance status no worse than Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) of 2 or a\n general status of Karnofsky Score (KPS) at least 70 %\n Exclusion Criteria:\n - A pathological diagnosis confirmed to be WHO grade IV glioma (i.e., glioblastoma\n multiforme) or grade I disease (i.e., pilocystic astrocytoma)\n - Radiographic evidence of gliomatosis cerebri\n - Prior cranial irradiation for any reasons"

Claudin 18.2 is\n overexpressed in a significant proportion of gastric, esophageal, and pancreatic\n adenocarcinomas and its restricted expression makes it a promising therapeutic target for the\n treatment of these carcinomas. Moreover, studies have found that immunoglobulin superfamily\n CD47 is overexpressed widely across tumor types, and CD47 plays an important role in\n suppressing phagocytes activity through binding to the transmembrane protein SIRP\u03b1 in\n phagocytic cells. Hence by targeting both pathways, one can direct macrophage-mediated\n phagocytotic activity to tumor cells by blocking the \"don't eat me signal\" mediated by CD47/\n SIRP\u03b1 interaction, potentially offering a better safety profile than anti-CD47 monoclonal\n antibodies.\n This is an open label, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics\n (PK) and preliminary efficacy of PT886 in subjects with advanced or refractory cancers.\n Patients with the following tumor types will be eligible for screening: unresectable or\n metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, and\n pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) for which there is no available standard therapy.\n ;NA;\n Inclusion Criteria:\n 1. 18 years or older and able to sign informed consent and comply with the protocol.\n 2.

Neratinib is in a\n class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal\n protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor\n cells. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates.\n It is composed of a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug,\n called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive tumor cells in a targeted way and\n delivers deruxtecan to kill them.
